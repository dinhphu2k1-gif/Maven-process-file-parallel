Benefits of Threads#
Higher throughput, though in some pathetic scenarios it is possible to have the overhead of context switching among threads steal away any throughput gains and result in worse performance than a single-threaded scenario. However such cases are unlikely and an exception, rather than the norm.

Responsive applications that give the illusion of multi-tasking.

Efficient utilization of resources. Note that thread creation is light-weight in comparison to spawning a brand new process. Web servers that use threads instead of creating new processes when fielding web requests, consume far fewer resources.

All other benefits of multi-threading are extensions of or indirect benefits of the above.
